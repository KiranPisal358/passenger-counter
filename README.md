# passenger-counter

This is a very simple project that you can take to boost your javascript skills.
I have created a small project as passenger counter to make my hands dirty with practicing samll tasks.
It was a very beautiful experience that I have enjoyed.
Let's give it a try by following resources.
You can also go through the Scrimba-"www.scrimba.com"

All the best.
